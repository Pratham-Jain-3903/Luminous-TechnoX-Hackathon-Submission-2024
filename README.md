## Implementation Note

To minimize costs associated with real-time compute on AWS SageMaker, we implemented models and pre-computed values for 7 days in advance. This setup emulates fetching these values from Grafana using aggregated database tables while ensuring a realistic user experience. 

## Data Sources

- **TOU Tariff Data**: Data generated using the **Tariff of Time of Use (ToU) Indian Power System Dataset** from [Mendeley Data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/7g9frz6sm8/1), normalized for commercial rates per unit. The system loops these values to simulate upcoming tariff rates.
- **Solar Power Generation & Consumption**: Cleaned data provided by **Luminous** after the initial Q&A session, looped to mimic continuous solar power generation and consumption.

Our ML models were trained using the above split and augmented data, validated against actual user consumption data from **InAnalytics**. This serves as a robust baseline for real consumer data 
integration.

### We have utilized the Pycarat library for quick prototyping and trial and error on over 20 ML models for each prediction feature
